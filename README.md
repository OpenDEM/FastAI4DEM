# FastAI4DEM
FastAI templates for Super-resolution of Digital Elevation Models.

+ SRCNN
+ SRCNN with ResBlock
+ VDSR
+ EPSCN

**These are only templates, no better results could be achieved than with a simple bicubic upsampling.**
If you achieve any proper results please get in contact.

Have a look at [https://opendem.info/superResolution.html](https://opendem.info/superResolution.html) for detailed information. 

Based on the implementations of benymd [GitHub](https://github.com/benymd/super_resolution).

The Notebook is running on Google Colab with data storage on Google Drive. Of course this could be adapted to local resources.
